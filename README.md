# Practice using `git pull`

Here's a small project that will let you test out using Git's [pull](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull) command.

## Setup

1. clone this project
2. `cd` into this project's directory
3. run `$ ./setup.sh`
4. use `$ git pull` to sync local repo with the remote one

You can run steps 3 and 4 as many times as you want.
